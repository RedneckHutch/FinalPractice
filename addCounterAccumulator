#instructions - add the following:
###  a counter that counts how many times the user enteres a valid proprty lot number
###  an accumulator that accululates all the tax amount each time it is calculated
###  one print line (at the end of the program) with text that shows the number of lots that were entered (the counter)
###  one print line (at the end of the program) with text that shows the total amount of tax that was figured
###  calculate the average tax
###  one print line (at the end of the program) with text that shows the average tax amount
