#  Question 1  - what type of variable is DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE? 
#  CONST
DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE = 0.20

# The main function.
def main():
    # Question 2 - what does this line of code do?
    # This line of code is setting whatever the function get_regular_price()
    # to variable named reg_price
    reg_price = get_regular_price()

    # Question 3 - what does this line of code do?
    # This line is making a variable to store a calculation of reg price and
    # the function discount price.
	
	# Question 4 - what is the term that refers to (reg_price)
    # return type
	
	# Question 5 - what happens because (reg_price) is included in this function call?
    # it allows the function to find the information store in red_price
    # and will use it to execute the functions code.
    sale_price = reg_price - discount(reg_price)

    # Question 6 - what is accomplished with the following line of code?
    # Prints out "The sale price is $", then it formats how many decimals 
    # sale and price will go out to which in this case is .00
    # and then seperates
	
	# Question 7 - explain what impact it has to add .2f
    # Huge impact it allows a number like 18.3333333 to only go
    # to to decimal places like 18.33
    print('The sale price is $', format(sale_price, ',.2f'), sep='')

# Question 8 - what does this block of code accomplish?
# It ask the user to enter an items price and store ut as price, then returns it.

# Question 9 - what does the code return price accomplish?
# returning it allows it to be used within other functions and stored outside the function.
def get_regular_price():
    price = float(input("Enter the item's regular price: "))
    return price

# Question 10 - what does this block of code accomplish?
# this code computes the after it is discounted

# Question 11 - what is the term for (price)?
# price is the term which is returned from get_regular_price()

# Question 12 - what does the code return price * DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE do?
# It returns the value of the calculation and and stores it as price once again,
# this will replace the prior value that was held to the variable price.
def discount(price):
    return price * DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE

# Question 13 - what does the following line of code accomplish?
# this line of code is calling the main function this is where you would
# put all your function callings in order to get them to run correctly
main()

# Question 14 - Explain in your own words what this program accomplishes
# This program gets a const discount price and then ask the user for a price.
# Then the program computes the new price after applying the discount and stores
# it as price.
